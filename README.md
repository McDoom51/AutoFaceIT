AutoFaceIT is a Python script designed to automate the launching of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) with FaceIT Anti-Cheat. It ensures that CSGO is closed, launches FaceIT Anti-Cheat if it is not already running, and then launches CSGO again. The script continuously monitors the CSGO and FaceIT Anti-Cheat processes to maintain the desired state.

## Features:
- Automatic closure of CSGO when it is detected.
- Launching of FaceIT Anti-Cheat if it is not already running.
- Continuous monitoring of CSGO and FaceIT Anti-Cheat processes.
- Flexibility to adapt to different system configurations.
- Logging of events and errors for traceability and debugging.

AutoFaceIT provides an automated solution to streamline the process of launching CSGO with FaceIT Anti-Cheat, enhancing the convenience and user experience for players.
